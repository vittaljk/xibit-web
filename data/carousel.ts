      `At x'ibit, we’re proud to have played a part in creating Ishavasya—a home deeply
        connected to devotion, designed by Spellbound and carefully brought to life by our
        team. This 2600 sq. ft. space in Svasa Homes is more than just a home; it’s a place
        of faith, inspired by a client who wanted to build a peaceful space as a tribute to the
        divine.`,
      `Our job was to bring this vision to life, faithfully translating each design detail with
        care and respect for the sacred meaning behind it. We worked closely with the
        designers, making sure we understood the purpose of every material, symbol, and
        feature, so that the final space would reflect the intended devotion.`,
      `Creating Ishavasya took skill and careful attention, from installing temple-inspired
        flooring to adding symbolic art and sacred colors throughout. Spellbound chose
        materials like Kota and Kadapa stone to capture a timeless, reverent feel, and hand-
        picked artwork from epics and history to add layers of storytelling to each room.`,
      `Crafting such a home also meant handling fine details with care, from the mother-
        of-pearl inlays to zardozi embroidery and custom woodwork. As residents enter
        Ishavasya, they’re welcomed by a striking piece of Lord Hanuman carrying Lord
        Rama—a powerful image of the bond between the divine and the devotee, set
        against a vermillion-dyed veneer, specially sourced from Italy.`,
      `With close attention to every detail, we made sure that Ishavasya became more than
        just a home.`,

      `At x'ibit, we had the pleasure of executing The New York Loft, a thoughtfully
        designed 2600 sq. ft. home at Svasa Homes, Bangalore. This unique project,
        designed by Spellbound, was envisioned as a comfortable retreat for the client's
        daughter, who visits from the US before heading to their hometown in Chikmagalur.
        The design sought to recreate the charm and character of a New York loft, blending
        casual elegance with personal touches.`,
      `In the living area, we brought the designer’s vision to life with a dark duco-finished
        dummy fireplace that mimics a leathery texture, adding depth and character to the
        room. We also installed a sliding door arrangement in the entertainment area.
        These MDF doors, adorned with life-size prints, conceal a projector and drop-down
        screen, creating a multifunctional space with a theatrical flair. The furniture,
        carefully sourced in leather, enhances the room’s casual yet sophisticated vibe.
        Moving to the master bedroom, we crafted an inclined wooden false ceiling,
        echoing the loft aesthetic. An open wardrobe enclosed with sheer curtains
        provides a warm and cozy feel while maintaining functionality. Track lighting
        highlights the space, creating a gallery-like ambiance that elevates the overall
        design.`,
      `A key feature of this home is the New York-inspired grid in the living area, designed
        to resemble a window overlooking a wallpaper depicting vibrant New York pop
        culture. This element injects an artistic energy, tying the home’s design back to its
        cosmopolitan theme.`,
      `With attention to detail and expert craftsmanship, x'ibit executed every element of
        The New York Loft to perfection. The result is a home that embodies the spirit of a
        New York loft while ogering the warmth and comfort of a family sanctuary—a
        space where personal stories come to life.`,
